# Project Name: Udemy Dashboard
I joined a 30 Days Data Analytics learning challenge to pracrice and improve my Analytical thinking and data visualization skills.

# Project Objective
The main aim of this project is to analyze the dataset and create insights.

# Data Sourcing
Dataset was gotten via Udemy Web scrapping. I imported dataset to Powerquery on MSExcl.

# Tool Used for Data preparation and Visialization
MsExcel (Power Query and Pivot Table)

# Data Transformation
## Cleaning and Preparing the data. 

For the cleaning processes,I removed the columns that were not mandatory for the analysis such as the Url, I also changed some columns names, so this can readable to anyone reading through.

I Appended the queries, to make the analysis easier, as the columns headers had the same titles and formats.

The data was good to go for visualiazation, then i realized the date format had time inclusive, for the insights i was to create, there was no need for time. Then i proceed to change the format to date only. Afterwards the data was clean and set for Visualiazation.

## According to the Visualization Above
Web Development happens to be the only Subject whose course was offered for the year 2011. Web development tops every charts against other subjects offered by udemy in the year 2011-2017 in general except Subject Ratings, which Business finance leads in the general visualization. Using the slicers of years in this analysis it shows that for the year 2012 and 2016, Web Development tops every chart in this analysis.

While Business Finance Tops the Subject Ratings chart for other years, this subject revenue only surpassed Web development revenue once and that is the year 2014, because more courses on business finance was subcribed to.

The musical Instrument generated high revenue than Business Finance and Graphic Design course in the year 2012 ,then more than graphic design in 2013,2014, and 2016 while Graphic Design course genrated more in the year 2015,and 2017. It can be concluded that because of the high subcriber in the year 2012 and 2013, could have been the reason why musical instrument subject more generated revenue than graphic design subject. As at 2013, Business Finance revenue has always been higher than bothg Graphic design and Musical instruments subjects.

# Conclusion and Recommendation 
Every year has it's own subcribers but for the year 2016, Udemy released more courses for each subjects that had all Levels, hence there was very high Subcribers for Web Development courses which generates the highest revenue so far. Other courses also generates revenue but not as much as Web Development.
Research studies show that Udemy offers the best Tech online courses hence why there's high subcribers every year for Web Development. It can be advised that More of Web Development courses without neglecting other subjects should be released every year as susbcribers prefers the paltform than others to learn. This will keep Tech learners and exisiting Subcribers wanting to know more because of the undiluted and huge content the platform has to offer.
